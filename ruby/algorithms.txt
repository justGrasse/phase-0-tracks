Mr. Roboto's Elevator Algorithm

- Determine which floor you are on
- If you are on the right floor, YOU DID IT!
- Otherwise if your destination is higher than your floor
	- Select the button pointing up
- Otherwise if your destination is lower than your floor
	- Select the button pointing down
- When the elevator door opens
	- Enter the Elevator
- Navigate to the buttons
- From the buttons scan for the button indicating your desired floor
	- If you found the button
		- Click the button
	- Otherwise get out of the elevator and look for help
- Locate the screen indicating which floor you are on (it will be changing)
- Once the screen says your selected floor and the door opens
	- Exit the Elevator.
