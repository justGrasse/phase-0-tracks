	1. The purpose of semantic tags is to provide organization and meaning to your html code.  I think the header and footers are almost always used and in the main body main, section, and figure tend to be common.  However, these are really specific on the website you're building.

	2. Elements are displayed as they are listed, top to bottom, unless specified otherwise by the CSS.

	3. How to create easy to use templates called snippets.  Yes, I'll definitely be using this awesome wizardry! It seems like such a time saver!

	4. There wasn't anything particularly challenge.  I was pretty familiar with HTML coming into this week, so I think practice and getting cool snippets is important to do asap!  Especially since the material is fresh.
